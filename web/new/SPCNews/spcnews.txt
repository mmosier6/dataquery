New Meso Analysis Page has been implemented on March 27, 2012.
Changes include: 1) overlay/underlay select buttons moved from the bottom to the side based on user feedback.
2) current SPC products are displayed in a hovered window at the lower-right of the page to facilitate better
situational awareness as new products are issued.
3) A Trends/Forecast section has been added.
This allows the user to view trends in the parameter being examined, and even project the data into the
future for selected parameters.
The images are viewed when you mouseover the selected past/forecast hour.
Past images are of the SfcOA system, while future images are based on RUC model output.
Another use for this function is to compare the SfcOA Analysis of a selected parameter to the RUC
forecast for the same parameter at 00H.
This may provide useful information regarding the performance of the model.
