Effective Wednesday, November 1, 2017, SPC has a new High Resolution Ensemble Forecast version 2 (HREFv2) web page (<a href="/exper/href/">www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/href/</a>) that is found under the Forecast Tools section of the main SPC home page. The HREFv2 provides an operational version of the SPC SSEO and this new web page replaces the existing SSEO page. The new HREFv2 viewer provides a much improved interactive web page with additional ensemble products, options, and functionalities, and is updated as hourly forecast member grids are processed. It contains advanced guidance for many weather hazards, with tabs for synoptic, severe, winter, fire, precipitation, and CAM storm attributes, that can be displayed over a CONUS domain or one of nine regional sectors. There is also capability to select from a number of product and map overlays. (Updated: November 1 2017)

On April 17, 2014, SPC introduced an experimental version of the preliminary daily storm report summary through
several enhancements on a new webpage <a href="/exper/reports/" target="_blank">www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/reports/</a>.
These enhancements include a new page framework and layout, improved functionality and personalization.
More information from each Local Storm Report (LSR) will be accessible, and winter weather LSRs will now be included.
Since this service is experimental, these reports may <strong>NOT</strong> contain edited, deleted or added
reports that are currently performed as needed in the "operational" <a href="/climo/online/" target="_blank">LSR</a> webpage.
Again, LSRs should always be considered <strong>PRELIMINARY</strong>.

future for selected parameters.
The images are viewed when you mouseover the selected past/forecast hour.
Past images are of the SfcOA system, while future images are based on RUC model output.

On March 8, 2011, the SPC removed space/time filtering on incoming National Weather Service (NWS) Local Storm Reports (LSRs).
This filtering had been used by SPC in an attempt to reduce duplicate reports and limit artificially inflated initial estimates of severe weather events when many reports arrived for the same event.
Space/time filtering is no longer being applied to decoded NWS LSRs and this approach is consistent with NWS storm-based verification methods.
However, identical reports should still be removed from SPC logs and should not appear on the preliminary maps and lists.
