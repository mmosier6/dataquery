New Meso Analysis Page has been implemented on March 27, 2012.
Changes include: 1) overlay/underlay select buttons moved from the bottom to the side based on user feedback.
2) current SPC products are displayed in a hovered window at the lower-right of the page to facilitate better
situational awareness as new products are issued.
3) A Trends/Forecast section has been added.
This allows the user to view trends in the parameter being examined, and even project the data into the
future for selected parameters.
The images are viewed when you mouseover the selected past/forecast hour.
Past images are of the SfcOA system, while future images are based on RUC model output.
Another use for this function is to compare the SfcOA Analysis of a selected parameter to the RUC
forecast for the same parameter at 00H.
This may provide useful information regarding the performance of the model. (Updated: Mar 27 2012)

NCEP is pleased to announce the first edition of NCEP's online Newsletter, which will appear on a quarterly basis.
The newsletter, suggested as a result of a review of NCEP conducted by the University Corporation of Atmospheric Research (UCAR), will be distributed to NCEP customers and partners to keep them apprised of the breadth of NCEP activities.
The newsletter can be accessed via a link from NCEP's homepage <<a href="http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/">http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/</a>, as well as from links from each of the NCEP Centers.

<p>Beginning March 15, 2011, the SPC will provide multimedia weather briefings on an experimental basis for most Moderate and all High Risk severe weather days during the Day 1 period.
As a supplement to the Public Severe Weather Outlook (PWO), these once-per-day recorded briefings will be available during the early morning hours (approximately 6:00-10:30 am Central) on the SPC website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On March 8, 2011, the SPC removed space/time filtering on incoming National Weather Service (NWS) Local Storm Reports (LSRs).
This filtering had been used by SPC in an attempt to reduce duplicate reports and limit artificially inflated initial estimates of severe weather events when many reports arrived for the same event.
Space/time filtering is no longer being applied to decoded NWS LSRs and this approach is consistent with NWS storm-based verification methods.
However, identical reports should still be removed from SPC logs and should not appear on the preliminary maps and lists.</p>
