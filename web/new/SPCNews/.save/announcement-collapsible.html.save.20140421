  On April 17, 2014, SPC introduced an experimental version of the preliminary daily storm report summary through
  several enhancements on a new webpage <a href="/exper/reports/" target="_blank">www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/reports/</a>.
  These enhancements include a new page framework and layout, improved functionality and personalization.
  More information from each Local Storm Report (LSR) will be accessible, and winter weather LSRs will now be included.
  Since this service is experimental, these reports may <strong>NOT</strong> contain edited, deleted or added
  reports that are currently performed as needed in the "operational" <a href="/climo/online/" target="_blank">LSR</a> webpage.
  Again, LSRs should always be considered <strong>PRELIMINARY</strong>.
  For more details on the improvements, please refer to the SPC FAQ page <a href="/faq/#6.14" target="_blank">here</a>.
  We welcome your questions and comments regarding the new page, please click on the <strong>Comments</strong> button on the page to provide your feedback.
