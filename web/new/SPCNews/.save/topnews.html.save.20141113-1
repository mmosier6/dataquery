Effective Tuesday, December 16, 2014, at 1500 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the SPC Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlooks for the Continental U.S. will transition from experimental to operational status (see <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/notification/scn14-54spc_day4-8severe.htm" target="_blank">NWS Service Change Notice 14-54</a>).
The Day 4-8 Outlook will include areas where total severe weather probabilities are at least 15 percent within 25 miles of a point, in addition to the current "severe" areas corresponding to a 30 percent or greater probability.
Examples of these Outlooks using historical data and additional information are online at: <a href="/exper/dy4-8example/" target="_blank">http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/dy4-8example/</a>. (Updated: November 12 2014)

The experimental SPC Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 Convective Outlooks for the Continental U.S. will include two new risk categories:<br />
      - "Marginal" replaces the current SEE TEXT used in these products<br />

On April 17, 2014, SPC introduced an experimental version of the preliminary daily storm report summary through
several enhancements on a new webpage <a href="/exper/reports/" target="_blank">www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/reports/</a>.
These enhancements include a new page framework and layout, improved functionality and personalization.
More information from each Local Storm Report (LSR) will be accessible, and winter weather LSRs will now be included.
Since this service is experimental, these reports may <strong>NOT</strong> contain edited, deleted or added
reports that are currently performed as needed in the "operational" <a href="/climo/online/" target="_blank">LSR</a> webpage.
Again, LSRs should always be considered <strong>PRELIMINARY</strong>.
For more details on the improvements, please refer to the SPC FAQ page <a href="/faq/#6.14" target="_blank">here</a>.
We welcome your questions and comments regarding the new page, please click on the <strong>Comments</strong> button on the page to provide your feedback.  (Updated: April 17 2014)

<p>Beginning March 15, 2011, the SPC will provide multimedia weather briefings on an experimental basis for most Moderate and all High Risk severe weather days during the Day 1 period.

<p>On March 8, 2011, the SPC removed space/time filtering on incoming National Weather Service (NWS) Local Storm Reports (LSRs).
This filtering had been used by SPC in an attempt to reduce duplicate reports and limit artificially inflated initial estimates of severe weather events when many reports arrived for the same event.
Space/time filtering is no longer being applied to decoded NWS LSRs and this approach is consistent with NWS storm-based verification methods.
However, identical reports should still be removed from SPC logs and should not appear on the preliminary maps and lists.</p>
