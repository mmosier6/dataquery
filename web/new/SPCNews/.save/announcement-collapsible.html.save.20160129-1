    Click <a href="/wcm/#2015-wbc-anoms">here</a> to view 2015 Tornado and Severe Thunderstorm Watch counts by county and the 2015 county count departure from the 2003 to 2015 averages. Tornado watch counts were above the norm from Texas northward across the high plains. The big deficit in 2015 came in the form of below normal numbers of Severe Thunderstorm Watches, with the greatest deficits occurring from the central Great Plains east to the Mid Atlantic. Some areas in this swath were 13 Severe Thunderstorm Watches below the norm.
