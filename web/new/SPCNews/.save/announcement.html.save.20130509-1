The SPC <a href="/exper/mesoanalysis/">Mesoanalysis Page</a> now has an option to incorporate the experimental ESRL
Rapid Refresh version 2 (RAPv2) model as background input for the mesoanalysis fields, in addition to the current
operational NCEP Rapid Refresh (RAP) model.
The RAPv2 is being developed by ESRL as the next version of the RAP.
More details about the RAP and RAPv2 are found at: <a href="http://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">rapidrefresh.noaa.gov</a>.
