          The SPC will be replacing the current SEE TEXT reference in its Day 1 and Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook products with
          graphical depictions of areas of Elevated Risk and areas of Isolated Dry Thunderstorms.
          Starting on September 24, 2013 at 1500 UTC, previews of these changes will be available on the Fire Weather Outlook page.

          <p><strong><font color="#ff0000">Survey:</font></strong>
          The NWS is undertaking its annual research to better serve the public's needs and request that you take the NWS 2013
          Customer Satisfaction Survey at:
          <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/nwsexit.pl?url=https://cfigroup.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_bCyQV2ZNlA8IRNj&LOC=1" target="_blank">https://cfigroup.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_bCyQV2ZNlA8IRNj&LOC=1</a>
          The core section of the survey takes about 20 minutes to complete and does not need to be finished all at once.
          You are also encouraged to take a moment and complete one or more of the additional sections covering Climate,
          Fire Weather, Hydrology, and Hurricane Services. (Updated: September 10 2013)</p>
